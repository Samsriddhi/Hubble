Estimating the Hubble Constant using the MCMC algorithm

AIM- An estimation of the Hubble Constant H0 to a precision of 2.1% using machine learning and intricate datasets. 

Most precise measurements are inferred from data of the Cepheid distances to Type 1A Supernovae (SNe Ia) host galaxies and distances of SNe Ia in galaxies with observable precession due to the expansion of the universe as per the Hubble Law. Up-to-date H0 measurements tend to have systematic uncertainties, thus the need for intricate datasets. To have a closer estimate, recent extensive data from Reiss et al and Dhawan et al has been used as we analyse SNe Ia as standard candles in Cepheid galaxies in the NIR (near infrared region), where luminosity variations in the supernovae and extinction by dust are both reduced. 

I use Bayesian statistics for analysing the data and inference as it works efficiently and provides scope in machine learning, future predictions and works with data with limitations. Coupled with the best complementary sources of Cepheid calibration, 2.1% precision is reached and H0 = (71.77 Â± 2.2 err kms1Mpc1) is calculated.
